# Investment Decision with Annual Financial Statements


## The Stock Market

The stock market is where a person or entity can buy and sell publicly held companies' stocks.  The stock market is very volatile and many factors, such as interest rate, unemploymet, inflation, etc.  Though investing in the stock market has become more accessible with apps such as Robinhood, figuring out a good stock to buy and sell for profit is not an easy task.  With this project I seek to build a machine learning model that will use information found in companies annual financial statement to predict whether the company's stock will be a good one year investment.

## 1. Data

The dataset used in this project was found in the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018) website.  There are 5 different datasets that represents 5 different years worth of data ranging from 2014 to 2018.  The 2 main columns in the datasets are the price variance percentage, which indicates the percentage gain or loss through out that year, and the class column that indicates invest or decline (1 or 0) which is dictated by a positive or negative price variance percentage.
